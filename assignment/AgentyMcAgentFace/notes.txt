- We implemented a greedy hand coded algorithm for this assignment.
- We found that the noise level was quite high for playing accurate shots in all moves. Hence, our strategy is to find the most crowded coin(most number of neighbours within a certain radius) and try to hit that coin with high power towards its nearest pocket. Towards the end of the game, when not many coins are left, the most crowded coin choice yields coins with no neighbours. In this case, the agent tries to take a straight shot towards the nearest pocket. If a straight shot is not possible, we try to hit the coin from the position with x = 0.5.
